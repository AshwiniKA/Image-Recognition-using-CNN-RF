# Image-Recognition-using-CNN-RF
Our goal is to implement fruit recognition using Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) by training the Fruits 360 dataset
available on kaggle. We aim to develop a feature extraction technique with convolutional neural networks. 
On extracted features (with CNN),random forest classifier is used to classify the images.
