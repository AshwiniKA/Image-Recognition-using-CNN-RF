# Image-Recognition-using-CNN-RF
Our goal is to implement fruit recognition using Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) by training the Fruits 360 dataset
available on kaggle. Feature extraction technique with convolutional neural networks is developed. 
On extracted features (with CNN),random forest classifier is used to classify the images.
